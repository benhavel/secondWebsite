This included debugging the line, and finding where the line was breaking down, fixing and reporting it. ● Trained over 100 staff, including senior executives through the production line to ensure they knew how to produce products efficiently with the proper organization and with speed. ● Created routing forms for each type of product on a weekly basis to effectively move the products through the line, allowing each staff member to know exactly what they have to do with that product. </p>

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">Prepared laser etched masters that created CD replicas. I maintained and organized the entire library of these masters which totaled to over 40,000. I was personally trained on CD Master Analysis 
                        equipment, master-cleaning machines, CD & DVD Replication machines & CD Printing functions. I learned this CD production line all the way through and helped produce over 150,000 discs in my years of working in this department. 

                        ●   Prepared through the scrutiny of visual inspection and test analysis 19,003 masters for replicating over 150,000 discs.
                        ●   Personally kept an entire library of these masters properly filed, coated, logged into an inventory and pulled for production on a weekly basis over these years. With a total of almost 50,000 masters pulled for production and filed away with all proper protective coating procedures done to them.
                        ●   Handled CD masters with hands on machine investigation and analyses to better preserve the lifespan of the CD masters themselves for the production line, each master costing the organization $100 each, therefore saving the organization thousands of dollars, if not more with my work.</p>

                            <p>After one conversation with Ben you'll notice something special about him: the quality of his character is top notch. From the moment we first spoke during a front-end coding project at Codify Academy, I was struck with enthusiasm and vigor I rarely see in people. It was so very refreshing to have such a positive attitude alongside someone so hard working; never afraid to ask questions with a willingness to grow. Throughout our working alongside together, I saw the quality of his work was parallel to the outstanding character I had come to know. Ben is an awesome dude and someone who keeps the energy flowing in a progressive way. He is a perfect fit for any working environment that promotes friendly team-based attitudes and synergies for success. As well as, he is a highly competent and effective programmer. Definitely a great choice for the job at hand.</p>

                            <p>Ben is a very easy person to work with and pays attention to what is needed and wanted and to detail. He is systematic and logical and he doesn't just do something how he thinks it needs to be done but he finds out how it should be done and then does that to professional standards. It was my pleasure and honor to work with him a couple of years ago at a CD manufacturing plant and the masters he was in charge of had an excellent usage rate. He also expanded his team worth and so learned how to produce the CDs and also learned to make the silk screens for their printing. I would love to work with Ben again should the opportunity come up!</p>
